HRConnect Project 2
## TASK 3
Add breakpoint in each program at various places and learn usage of pdb library.
Your project name should be "HRConnect" and project structure should be as
follows -
```
├── HRConnect (project root)
│ ├── my_utils (your custom package)
│ │ ├── __init__.py
│ │ ├── csv.py (csv file related functions)
├── task_one.py (entry-point for task 1)
├── task_two.py (entry-point for task 2)
├── README.md (your documentation on project)
```
csv.py file should contain a class somewhat like following -
class HandleCSV:
filename = "<absolute-path-of-downloaded-file-here>"


@classmethod
def read_entire_csv(cls):
with open(cls.filename, "r") as foo:
return foo.readlines()
@classmethod


def read_csv_line_by_line(cls):
with open(cls.filename) as bar:
yield bar.readline()


# TODO - ADD MORE SUCH METHODS HERE
# TODO - UNDERSTAND USAGE OF `classmethod` HER
